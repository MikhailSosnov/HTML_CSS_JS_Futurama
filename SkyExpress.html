        <b> Bender Bending Rodríguez </b>(designated in-universe as Bending Unit
        22, unit number 1,729, serial number 2716057[1]) <br />According to the
        character's backstory, Bender was built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other
        characters refer to his "swarthy Latin charm") a reference to bending in
        Mexican maquiladoras. Viewers are informed, through his own testimony,
        of Bender's prejudice against non-robots. For example, one of his
        signature expressions is "kill all humans".
      </div>
      <div class="item item_2">
        <b> Turanga Leela</b> (born July 29, 2975)[2][3] is the captain of the
        Planet Express Ship of Futurama, the granddaughter of Munda's Mother and
        the great-granddaughter of Munda's Grandmother, the daughter of Turanga
        Morris and Turanga Munda and the mother of Kif Kroker's Offspring (Amy
        Wong's adoptive children). <br />With a "no rain or sleet" attitude and
        a "kick-your-ass" grace, this delivery captain is a refreshing source of
        professionalism to counterpoint the rest of the crew.
      </div>
      <div class="item item_3">
        <b>Philip J. Fry</b> (born August 14, 1974 - January 1, 2000; thawed on
        December 31, 2999), commonly known simply by his surname Fry, is the
        main protagonist of the animated sitcom Futurama. Fry was a native to
        the 20th century who was cryogenically frozen seconds into the year
        2000, having fallen in just as 1999 ended. He was revived in 2999 and
        subsequently became a Delivery boy for the Planet Express Company. Fry
        has fair skin and red hair with two spikes at the front.

      <div class="item item_4">
        <b>Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth </b> (born April 9, 2841), better
        known as Professor Farnsworth, Professor or just Farnsworth, is the
        chief executive officer and a shareholder of Planet Express and the
        tetragonist of Futurama. <br />
        He is pushing the limits of even the 31st Century at an agе of well over
        160. Professor Farnsworth is one of six living relatives of Philip J.
        Fry, together with his own clone, Cubert J. Farnsworth,

      <div class="item item_5">
        Dr. John A. Zoidberg, MD, better simply known as Zoidberg, (born 2914),
        is the the on-staff physician at Planet Express in Futurama. He was born
        on the Planet Decapod 10 and moved to Earth to practice medicine after
        giving up comedy once. <br />
        Despite being a self-proclaimed expert on Humans, he called Philip J.
        Fry "young lady" when they first met and has confused Fry and Bender.
      </div>
      <div class="item item_6">
        <b>Amy Kroker </b> (née Wong), Ph.D. (born November or December 2979)[1]
        is the wife of Kif Kroker, and a member of the Planet Express delivery
        service. Amy used to be rather overweight as a child because she had an
        insatiable appetite. She was later able to lose all the weight and is
        currently able to control herself as an adult. However, she can lose
        control very easily such as in "The Prisoner of Benda" where she
        reverted to becoming fat and put Leela's body in bad shape when they
        switched bodies.
      </div>
      <div class="item item_7">
        <b>Hermes Conrad</b>
        (born 2959), is a Grade 34 Jamaican bureaucrat and the accountant at
        Planet Express in Futurama. He is afraid to make mistakes, as this may
        demote him to a lower grade. <br />
        Before working for Planet Express, Hermes represented Jamaica at the
        Olympics as, "a world-class limboer," (as his wife, LaBarbara, describes
        Hermes' early career as an athlete). His main rival, in limbo
        competitions, as well as in wooing LaBarbara, was Barbados Slim,
      </div>
      <div class="item item_8">
        <b>Captain Zapp Brannigan</b> (born June 30, 2972)[1] is an egotistical
        military officer for the Democratic Order of Planets and Earth's
        Government and captain of at least a ship: usually of the Earth ship
        Nimbus, but briefly of the luxury liner Titanic. Later in the series, he
        is introduced as a Twenty-Five Star General or General Major Webelo.
        <br />Although Zapp Brannigan is considered a great military hero by
        many people, most who have met him are less impressed by his goofy.
